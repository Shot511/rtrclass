<p>
<font style="font-weight: bold">What you will learn in this course</font>:
<ul>
<li>Learn OpenGL version 4.x and then you will be able to create 3D applications for Windows/Linux/MacOS and mobile devices,</li>
<li>Thanks to this knowledge you will be able to use WebGL technology which is based on OpenGL,</li>
<li>You will get to know OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) which will give you the ability to create outstanding effects.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<font style="font-weight: bold">What you will NOT learn in this course</font>:
<ul>
<li>You will not learn 3D mathematics. I assume that people who are interested in programming in OpenGL are familiar with vectors, matrices, quaternions, etc.,</li>
<li>I will not be teaching programming in C/C++/Java/C#. I assume that you can programm in one of the mentioned languages.</li>
</ul>
</p>
