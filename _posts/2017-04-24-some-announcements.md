I would love to announce the appearance of a new OpenGL course for beginners! New lessons will be Polish translations of a very good tutorials that can be found on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/ "LearnOpenGL"). Initial translations should appear in the near future :)  

I mentioned this undertaking in the [previous]({% post_url 2016-03-09-opengl-course-4-farewell %}) entry where I decided to end the OpenGL course, that was run on this site, mainly because of the fact that on the Internet appeared such tutorials as the one mentioned above.

In addition, I will continue development of the [Vertex Engine](https://github.com/Shot511/VertexEngine "Vertex Engine"), about which you can read more [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/projects).
